# Java Programming Lab - 5th Semester (Pokhara University)

Welcome to the **Java Programming Lab** repository for the 5th semester at Pokhara University. This repository contains lab assignments and practical implementations as per the syllabus, aimed at enhancing your understanding of core Java concepts, applets, multithreading, networking, JDBC, and more.

## Course Objectives

1. Understand the core principles of the Java programming language.
2. Learn to develop well-designed, effective standalone applications and applets using visual tools.
3. Implement socket programming and database handling using JDBC.
4. Develop multithreaded applications and understand Java networking.

## Lab Assignments

### Unit 1: Core Java
- **Lab 1:** Demonstrate the use of arrays, operators, and control structures.
- **Lab 2:** Create programs to illustrate inheritance, multilevel inheritance, and interface implementation in Java. Include custom package creation and usage.
- **Lab 3:** Implement Java exception handling mechanisms (try-catch-finally, throws, etc.).

### Unit 2: Applets
- **Lab 4:** Create a Java applet and embed it in an HTML page to understand the applet life cycle.

### Unit 3: Multithreading
- **Lab 5:** Create a multithreaded Java application, demonstrating thread priorities and synchronization.

### Unit 4: Java Input/Output (I/O)
- **Lab 6:** Demonstrate sequential and random reading and writing of files using Java I/O classes.

### Unit 5: Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- **Lab 7:** Design a form using AWT/Swing components, including various layouts and event handling.

### Unit 6: Networking with Java
- **Lab 8:** Implement TCP and UDP-based client-server communication in Java using sockets.

### Unit 7: Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)
- **Lab 9:** Demonstrate CRUD operations with JDBC and AWT/Swing controls for user interaction.

### Unit 8: Generics in Java
- **Lab 10:** Implement a generic class and methods, demonstrating the use of constructors, interfaces, and polymorphism with generics.
